Attached is the matlab code for cilia beat frequency and cilia metachronal wave analysis

The input is image series over a period of time at the same or different location;
The output is the corresponding image of cilia beat frequency or phase.

The phase image series derived from sliding window allows us to visualize and quantify the metachronal wave from the top view in 3D.
The detailed methods description can be found in the paper.
